# PluralKit docs

The documentation is built using [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). All website content is located in the `content/` subdirectory.

## Building
First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/). Then, run the `dev` command:

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

This will start a development server on http://localhost:8080/.

## Deployment
The docs are deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with CI.
