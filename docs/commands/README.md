# Command documentation (experimental)
Command documentation is defined in `commands.js`. `build.js` can export a JSON file consumed by other tools (hopefully?).

This documentation is loaded by the `CommandInfo` Vue component, used in `commands.md` for the command page (and maybe other places soon?).
