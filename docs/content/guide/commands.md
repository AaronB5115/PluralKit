# Command list

::: tip HOW TO READ THIS PAGE
Below is a list of all the commands the bot supports.

Highlighted spaces (eg. <Arg>system-name</Arg> ) are **arguments**, and you should **fill in the blank** with the relevant bit of text. The **Arguments** section below describes what to put in each blank.

When an argument asks for a **system ID**, you can either fill in a system's [5-character ID](./ids.md), **or** you can fill in a Discord account ID, or even a @mention. For example:
<CmdGroup>
<Cmd>system <Arg>exmpl</Arg></Cmd>
<Cmd>system <Arg>466378653216014359</Arg> list</Cmd>
<Cmd>system <Arg>@PluralKit#4020</Arg> fronter</Cmd>
</CmdGroup>

When an argument asks for a **member ID**, you can either fill in a member's [5-character ID](./ids.md), or, *if the member is in your own system*, their name. This means that to target a member in another system, you **must** use their ID.
