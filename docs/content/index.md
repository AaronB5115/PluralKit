# PluralKit
Front page goes here. Unfinished.

::: danger NOTE
If you're looking for the official PluralKit documentation, please see the official website:

[**https://pluralkit.me/**](https://pluralkit.me/)

This site will some day become the official documentation, **but it is not finished** and a lot of pages are still blank.
Treat it as a sneak peek.
